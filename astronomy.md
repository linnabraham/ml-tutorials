# Learn Astronomy

This is my effort to compile together a collection of resources for learning astronomy. The aim is to have a self-contained set of resources.
There are three problems that I am currently trying to tackle in astronomy. Hence the resource are centered on those questions.

1. Classification of galaxies based on their visual morphology
2. Detection of HI emitting sources from radio data cubes
3. Classification of solar active-regions into flaring or non-flaring
